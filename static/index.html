    <p>This is the homepage of Șerban Hartular. Șerban is an interesting person, for reasons
    that will surely become apparent in short order. Meanwhile, the web app hosted on 
    this site is also not without interest. The server side uses Flask. The client side is written in Svelte and TypeScript. The author would like to
    thank the creators of the latter two especially for making website development so much more pleasant.</p>
